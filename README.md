# Website for Spies

## Execution

To run the project, open the folder containing the source code in Visual Studio Code. If you haven’t already, install the "Open in Browser" extension by TechER.

Once that’s done, double-click on the "index.html" file and select "Open in Default Browser".

A window will then open in your browser with the homepage.

This is an individual project completed in 2022. *(<span style="color: magenta;">Please note: the website is in French.</span>)*

## About the Site

As soon as you access the site, you land on the homepage where you must enter a password. This password is required to access highly confidential information intended for spies. However, today I’ll make an exception and share it with you. Enter "G568GVGWHJ8" (or simply "Katia") in the designated field, then press "Validate".

Once the password is entered, you will be directed to the presentation page. There you’ll find detailed explanations accompanied by beautiful "Among Us" style illustrations explaining cryptography and its usefulness.

Scrolling down the page, you’ll find ways to stay in contact with the organization. The social media links are clickable but redirect to each platform’s homepage, and the addresses and email are fictional.

Additionally, as you scroll down, you can quickly return to the top by clicking a wonderful "Back to Top" button that lights up when you hover your mouse over it.

In the menu at the top, you can select the coding method you need. For each method, you’ll find a section where you can encode and decode a message using an encryption key. Once both fields are filled, type "encrypt" or "decrypt" as needed, and the resulting message will appear in the field below.

If you want to learn more, scroll down to read explanations about the selected encryption method along with a sample encryption.

Finally, if you want even more details, click on "click here" at the bottom of the page to access a Wikipedia page that provides full details, history, and more about the encryption method.

If you selected ASCII coding, which has a slightly different page layout from the others, you will first find information about the history of this coding, followed by the various sections where you can translate your message depending on the value it’s written in. Scrolling further down, you’ll find some information about the selected standard. You can choose the base in which your message is written at the top of the page, then you’ll be redirected to the corresponding section where you can enter your number or initial text, choose the base you want to convert it to, and the translation will appear in the field below.
